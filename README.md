# StockRegretCalculator
A python script which tells you how much you could have made (or lost) if you bought shares on the ASX yesterday, and sold them today.

The script allows you to type in stock codes (ASX only, for simplicity), the amount you would have spent on the stocks, and the price-point you want to compare them at (OPEN, CLOSE, LOW, HIGH). 
It then tells you how much you would have made (or lost) if you bought those stocks yesterday, and sold them today (for the chosen price point).
